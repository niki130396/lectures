# 1. Write a program that sums the elements of a list (list of integers), without using the built-in sum() function.
#    You can define your own list.

# 2. Write a program that multiples all the elements of a list (list of integers). You can define your own list.

# 3. Write a program that prints out the largest element of a list (list of integers). You can define your own list.

# 4. Write a program that counts the number of strings in a list, whose length is more than 2.
#    Print out the number of items, whose length is more than 2.
#    Define your own list of strings

# 5. Write a program that copies the elements of a list and creates an entirely new list.
#    Define your own list.

# 6. Write a program that flattens the following list: [[20,30,70],[30,90,10], [30,20], [70,90,10,80]]
#    Flattens means that there shouldn't be any nested structures in the final output.
