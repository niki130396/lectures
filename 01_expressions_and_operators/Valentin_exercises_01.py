# 1. Create a new variable (using the assignment operator).

String_variable = "Python"
Integer_variable = 5

# 2. Create a statement using the following expression: a + 5 - b (you need to define a and b).

a = 10
b = 5
print(a + 5 -b)

# 3. What is the difference between the `/` operator and the `//` operator?

 '/' would return a float type number and '//' an integer

# 4. Consider the following statements:

# x = 10.0
# y = (x < 100.0) and isinstance(x, float)

# What is the value of y?

True

# 5. Write an
# expression (or statement) to find the square root of 9.

x = 9
y = x ** 0.5

# 6. Write a statement to:
# Create a variable x with the value 100
# Increase the value of x fivefold using an augmented assignment operator

x = 100
x *= 5

# 7. Cast the string defined below into upper case.

s = "this should be upper case"
s = s.upper()

# 8. Make sure the below string starts with a capital letter.

x = "this should start with a capital letter."
x = x.capitalize()

# 9. Swap the cases of the letters of the string below - upper case letters become lower case and vice versa.

z = "tHIS STRING NEEDS IT'S CASE SWAPPED."
z = z.swapcase()
