# 1. Create a new variable (using the assignment operator).

# myname = 'Debora'
#
# print(myname)

# 2. Create a statement using the following expression: a + 5 - b (you need to define a and b).

# a = 10
# b = 20
#
# my_exp = a + 5 - b
#
# print(my_exp)

# 3. What is the difference between the `/` operator and the `//` operator?

#`/` operator - This division is used for floating-point number. Example:

# a = 20
# b = 10
#
# my_exp_1 = a / b
#
# print(my_exp_1)

#`//` operator - This division is used for integer number. Example:

# a = 20
# b = 10
#
# my_exp_2 = a // b
#
# print(my_exp_2)

# 4. Consider the following statements:
# x = 10.0
# y = (x < 100.0) and isinstance(x, float)
# What is the value of y?

# x = 10.0
# y = (x < 100.0) and isinstance(x, float)
# print (y)

# 5. Write an expression (or statement) to find the square root of 9.

# import math  # Import the math module
# expression = math.sqrt(9)
# print (expression)


# 6. Write a statement to:
# Create a variable x with the value 100
# Increase the value of x fivefold using an augmented assignment operator

# x=100
# x*=5
# print(x)

# 7. Cast the string defined below into upper case.
#
# s = "this should be upper case"
#
# cs = s.upper()
#
# print(cs)



# 8. Make sure the below string starts with a capital letter.
#
# x = "this should start with a capital letter."
#
# cx = x.capitalize()
#
# print(cx)


# 9. Swap the cases of the letters of the string below - upper case letters become lower case and vice versa.
#
# z = "tHIS STRING NEEDS IT'S CASE SWAPPED."
#
# sz = z.swapcase()
#
# print(sz)
