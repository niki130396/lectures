# 1. Create a new variable (using the assignment operator).


# 2. Create a statement using the following expression: a + 5 - b (you need to define a and b).


# 3. What is the difference between the `/` operator and the `//` operator?


# 4. Consider the following statements:
# x = 10.0
# y = (x < 100.0) and isinstance(x, float)
# What is the value of y?

# 5. Write an expression (or statement) to find the square root of 9.


# 6. Write a statement to:
# Create a variable x with the value 100
# Increase the value of x fivefold using an augmented assignment operator


# 7. Cast the string defined below into upper case.

s = "this should be upper case"

# 8. Make sure the below string starts with a capital letter.

x = "this should start with a capital letter."

# 9. Swap the cases of the letters of the string below - upper case letters become lower case and vice versa.

z = "tHIS STRING NEEDS IT'S CASE SWAPPED."
